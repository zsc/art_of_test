# Comprehensive Testing: From Theory to Practice

A comprehensive tutorial covering all aspects of testing - from theoretical foundations to practical implementations across software, hardware, and AI systems.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes:
- **Programming**: Proficiency in at least one programming language (examples are language-agnostic)

- **Computer Science**: Understanding of algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity
- **Systems**: Basic knowledge of computer architecture and operating systems
- **Statistics**: Probability theory and basic statistical concepts

## How to Use This Tutorial

- Each chapter is largely self-contained, though later chapters may reference earlier concepts
- Exercises include solutions in collapsible sections - attempt them before checking answers
- "Further Research" sections provide paths for deeper exploration
- Case studies illustrate real-world applications and failures
